         <p> The third game kicks off with Morocco who have had a historical run in their World Cup history go on against the favorites, Euro Winners, Portugal! Ronaldo suprisingly starting on the bench in an important game. Morocco get the early lead and oh my word what a header from Moroccan striker. Portugal start going all out attack but Moroccan goalie, Bononou is having a night to remember! The game is almost over and it is still 1-0 ! THE GAME ENDS! MOROCCO ADVANCE TO THE WORLD CUP SEMI FINALS! RONALDO IS OUT ON HIS LAST WORLD CUP, HE LEAVES THE PITCH CRYING.... so sad seeing one of the greats going out ! All though Ronaldo has beem getting alot of hate recently, we should all RESPECT him for what he has done to the beautiful game !

         <p> Final game of the quarter finals is on the way and France vs England begin. The best match of the quarter finals is among us leaving all the fans anxious. Tchouameni scores early in the game for France and what an absolute screamer! The game continues with all intensity uprising, and England tie the game with a penalty. The game proceeds to live up to the hype and Olivier Giroud with a goal to break the ice. OH MY ! England get a penalty to tie it up in the 84th minute and the man himself Harry Kane steps up to the plate. 3..2...1 and HE MISSES FROM THE SPOT!!! ENGLAND ARE OUT OF THE WORLD CUP! AGAINST THE REINING CHAMPS!
